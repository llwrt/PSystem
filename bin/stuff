Todo:

Emitter and Particle share a lot of the same methods,
but they are in different packages and don't share a base class

Add different types of Emitters and take all the fireworks stuff out
of the Emitters class. maybe something like FireEmitter or RainEmitter would be cool

Addative blending

TextureMapping the particles

try out some Post-processing, like motion blur

gravity wells, maybe place those with right mouse clicks
